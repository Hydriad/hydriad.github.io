            <p>I love anime, and I love telling that to people I meet because it's a great way to find other unexpected fans. My favorite series is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011?q=hunter%20x%20hunter" target="_blank">Hunter X Hunter</a>. Anime is a gateway drug to to kpop, and I'm now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vecSVX1QYbQ" target="_blank">hooked</a> on that as well. I'm listening to kpop as I write this.

            <p>I'm an avid reader. The escapism is what I'm after (same with anime), so I enjoy reading SciFi and Fantasy the most. My favorite book is <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i> by Patrick Rothfuss, which is sequel to <i>The Name of the Wind</i>.</p>

            <p>I live near Boston, MA, USA with my boyfriend <a href="https://kyledonahue.net/" target="_blank">Kyle</a>. I built his website, too. We've gone on many adventures together, and I look forward to more.</p>

            <p>Outdoors, I really enjoy hiking, camping, and backpacking. Cross-country skiing is my sport of choice in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the warmer months. I'm extremely interested in growing my own food and foraging for edible wild plants, but sadly am limited in that right now because I live in an urban area. I've had some great successes with indoor gardening, though!</p>

            <a>I'm an artist and a software engineer with a passion for building beautiful things.</a> Check out my <a href="./projects.php">projects</a> page to see what I've made recently.</p>
