    <h2>Murals</h2>

        I led the painting of two colorful murals in my office, where coworkers helped paint them over the course of a few months.

    <h3>Mountains (2017)</h3>
    <p class="desc">This one took two months to complete, with two coats of paint for each of the six layers of mountains. I drew a general guide of the mountain shapes for us to follow, but we free-handed the gentle bumps on each layer to make it more realistic.</p>

    <h3>Colorful triangles (2018 - 2019)</h3>
    <p class="desc">This one took a little over three months to complete. Again, two coats per triangle. It was difficult because we could never paint triangles that were adjacent to each other at the same time. In the future I'd do less colors (this one has nine), and mark the triangles on the wall in pencil instead of pen, as the pen ended up showing through some of the lighter colors. But I really love how it turned out!</p>
