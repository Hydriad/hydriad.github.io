            <p>I'm a software engineer working at VMWare on our Carbon Black cybersecurity response software. How did I get here? I want to tell my story in the hopes that a young person who's trying to figure their career out might read this and find it useful.</p>

            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>When I was a teenager, I loved to play and chat with people online. On some of those sites, users were able to edit the HTML and CSS of their own profiles: This launched me into my first exploration of web design. I learned a lot without even realizing it while trying to center items on the page, change colors, and autoplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU" target="_blank">edgy teen music</a>.</p>

            <p>I also entered online competitions in forums where someone would post a picture of their avatar, and participants would edit it to make the coolest profile picture we could. The poster would then choose their favorite one, and give the winner a prize in online currency. Entering those contests was where I started learning how to edit photos and make digital art using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. I still love GIMP because it's free and open source!</p>

            <h3>University</h3>
            <p>After graduaiting highschool in 2012, I decided to attend RPI and major in Information Technology and Web Science because I loved computers and nerd culture, and I knew that that most companies need computers and nerds in some capacity. RPI's <a href="https://science.rpi.edu/itws/programs/undergrad/bs" target="_blank">ITWS program</a> really stood out to me because it focused on teamwork and encouraged students to create their own concentrations.</p>
            <p>Two years in, after realizing that my favorite part of all of my projects was when I edited the user interface, I created my own concentration in User Experience. I got to choose the classes I wanted to take to meet that goal. I'm very grateful for that freedom, becuase it led me to some amazingly beneficial classes in design and usability. Key takeaway: find a flexible program!</p>

            <h3>Internships</h3>
            <p>In the summers of 2014 and 2015, I worked as a computer camp counselor with <a href="https://www.emaginationtechcamps.com/">Emagination Tech Camps.</a> They were the best two summers of my life: I worked closely with a team of counselors, taught kids how to code, and played ultimate frisbee during lunch every day. Both summers, I was promoted to Program Coordinator to organize the all-camp events and excursions because I had such enthusiasm for the outdoor games and a knack for getting others excited, too.</p>

            <h3>Working full-time</h3>
            <p>In my interviews with companies for a full-time position, I made it clear that I wanted a UI/UX-focused role -- somewhat to my detriment, because a lot of campus recruiting programs for software engineers were more generalized than that. But I got an offer from Carbon Black, a cybersecurity company, to be on their UI team!</p>

            <p>After graduating from RPI in 2016 with my Bachelorette of Science in ITWS, I started working as an Associate Software Engineer at Carbon Black. I was one of two women in the twenty-person office, which was intimidating at first, but my teammates and managers have always been supportive and encouraging. Our company has grown much larger since then, went public in 2018, and was acquired by VMWare in 2019. I'm still working on what I am most passionate about, building a beautiful and user-friendly user interface. Luckily, there is still much to be done.</p>
