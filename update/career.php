            <p>I'm a software engineer working at VMWare on our Carbon Black cybersecurity response software. How did I get here? I want to tell my story in the hopes that a young person who's trying to figure their career out might read this and find it useful.</p>

            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>When I was a teenager, I loved to play and chat with people online. On some of those sites, users were able to edit the HTML and CSS of their own profiles: This launched me into my first exploration of web design. I learned a lot without even realizing it while trying to center items on the page, change colors, and autoplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU" target="_blank">edgy teen music</a>.</p>

            <p>I also entered online competitions in forums where someone would post a picture of their avatar, and participants would edit it to make the coolest profile picture we could. The poster would then choose their favorite one, and give the winner a prize in online currency. Entering those contests was where I started learning how to edit photos and make digital art using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. I still love GIMP because it's free and open source!</p>

            <p>I took some Computer Science classes in high school and had a rough time trying to understand the more logical elements of programming with Visual Studio and Java. It truly felt like a foreign language with strange rules. But I had a wonderful teacher, Mrs. Incantalupo, and she helped me stick with it. Slowly I started understanding. One day she even printed out a loop that I was especially proud of and taped it on the classroom wall. I'll never forget her kindness and support.</p>

            <h3>University</h3>
            <p>After graduating highschool in 2012, I decided to attend RPI and major in Information Technology and Web Science (ITWS). I chose that major because I loved computers and nerd culture, and I knew that most companies need computers and nerds in some capacity. RPI's <a href="https://science.rpi.edu/itws/programs/undergrad/bs" target="_blank">ITWS program</a> really stood out to me because it focused on teamwork and encouraged students to create their own concentrations.</p>

            <p>Two years in, after realizing that my favorite part of all of my projects was when I got to make them look pretty (How did I not realize sooner?), I created my own concentration in User Experience. I got to choose the classes I wanted to take to meet that goal. I'm very grateful for that freedom, because it led me to some amazingly beneficial lessons in design and usability. Big thanks to Linda Kramarchyk and Richard Plotka for supporting me those four years.</p>

            <h3>Summers</h3>
            <p>During the summers of 2014 and 2015, I worked as a computer camp counselor with <a href="https://www.emaginationtechcamps.com/">Emagination Tech Camps.</a> I taught kids from ages 8-17 Java, Coding Basics with Python, Web Design, Photoshop, and outdoor games. I gained a love of teaching, especially beginner classes, because I remembered how hard it was for me when I started out.</p>

            <p>I loved being on big a team of counselors, all with different personalities and strengths. My strength was energy. Both summers, I was promoted to Program Coordinator to organize the all-camp events and excursions because I had such enthusiasm for the outdoor games and a knack for getting others excited, too. Some of us played ultimate frisbee during lunch every single day, and went swimming in a lake in our time off. Those were the best two summers of my life.</p>

            <h3>Transitions & working full-time</h3>
            <p>With the confidence I gained from computer camp, in my final year at RPI I became a Resident Assistant for a floor of 50 freshmen. It was challenging and rewarding to try as best I could to help them adjust to life away from home.</p>

            <p>I was starting my transition out of university at the same time, interviewing with companies for a full-time software engineering position. I made it clear that I wanted a UI/UX-focused role -- somewhat to my detriment, because a lot of campus recruiting programs for software engineers were more generalized than that. But I got an offer from Carbon Black, a cybersecurity company, to be on their UI team!</p>

            <p>After graduating in 2016 with my Bachelorette of Science in ITWS, I started working as an Associate Software Engineer at Carbon Black. I was one of two women in the twenty-person office, which was intimidating at first, but my teammates and managers have always been supportive and encouraging. Our company has grown much larger since then, went public in 2018, and was acquired by VMWare in 2019. I'm still working on what I am most passionate about, building beautiful user interfaces. Luckily, there is much to be done.</p>
