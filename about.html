            <p>Hi, I'm Hayley. What I really appreciate about moments in life is their transience. When seasons change, when I share a moment with someone I'll never see again, when I'm exploring a new place -- these are things I love. Because they will never happen again just as they are right now. I unexpectedly found a fitting description of this in the anime <i>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid:</i></p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Um, it seems like everyone here is being drawn to this place by something powerful. Do you have any idea what that is?"</p>
                <p>"Well, I think it's something that only exists in this place in this moment right now. And I think everyone loves that."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I love anime. My favorite series is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011?q=hunter%20x%20hunter" target="_blank">Hunter X Hunter</a>, and second favorite is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37965/Kaze_ga_Tsuyoku_Fuiteiru?q=run%20with%20&cat=anime">Run with the Wind</a>. I'm also an avid reader, mostly of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Memoirs. In all of these, the escapism is what I'm after. My favorite book is <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i> by Patrick Rothfuss, which is sequel to <i>The Name of the Wind.</i></p>

            <p>I live in the USA with my boyfriend <a href="https://kyledonahue.net/" target="_blank">Kyle</a>. I built his website, too. We've gone on many adventures together, and I look forward to more.</p>

            <p>Outdoors, I really enjoy hiking, camping, and backpacking. Cross-country skiing is my sport of choice in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the warmer months. I'm extremely interested in growing my own food and foraging for edible wild plants. Although I'm limited in that right now because I live in an urban area, I've had great success with indoor gardening!</p>

            <p>I'm an artist and a software engineer with a passion for building beautiful things. Head to my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> page to see what I've made recently.</p>
