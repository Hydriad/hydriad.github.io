            <p>Hi, I'm Hayley and I live in Upstate New York, USA. I like to surround myself with books, nature, and friends.</p>

            <p>What I really appreciate about moments in life is their transience. When seasons change, when I share a moment with a stranger, when I'm exploring a new place -- these are things I love. Because they will never happen again just as they are right now.

            <p>Outdoors, I enjoy hiking, camping, and backpacking. Cross-country skiing is my sport of choice in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the warmer months. I'm interested in growing my own food, and aspire to maintain a large garden one day. Although I'm limited in that right now, I've had great success with indoor gardening. </p>

            <p>I'm also an avid reader, mostly of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Memoirs. In all of these, the escapism is what I'm after. My favorite book is <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i> by Patrick Rothfuss, which is sequel to <i>The Name of the Wind.</i></p>

            <p>I'm an artist and a software engineer with a passion for making beautiful things. Head to my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> page to see what I've made recently.</p>
